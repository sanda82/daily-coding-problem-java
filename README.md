# Daily Coding Algorithm Problem in Java

## Problem #1266 [Medium]: 
> Given a list of numbers, create an algorithm that arranges them in order to form the largest possible integer. 
> For example, given `[10, 7, 76, 415]`, you should return `77641510`.

## Problem #1267 [Hard]:
> Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j) which returns the sum from the sublist `L[i:j]` (including i, excluding j).
> For example, given L = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `sum(1, 3)` should return `sum([2, 3])`, which is `5`.

## Problem #1269 [Medium]
> Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.
> For example, given the following matrix: `[[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]`
> You should return `[[7, 4, 1],[8, 5, 2],[9, 6, 3]]`
